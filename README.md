# gradflower

A generative javascript program that creates flowers using gradient fills. 
Inspired by work done by David Rudnick, you can find his website here: https://davidrudnick.org/. 
I also took inspiration from this amazing generative code playlist by Matthew Epler, you can watch it here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyRZnpOSgMj3K8AV2I6UldnvTj6d_Zrf0
